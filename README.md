This module's aim is to create an interactive map,
where you can see location of 10 the most closest
to your location places, where films were created in
the given year.

This is an educational project, which show my knowledge
in working with data and using folium python library
to create interactive maps.

Here you can see an example of a map, created by module,
using this data:
